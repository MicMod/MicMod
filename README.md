### Hello everyone <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
My name is MichaÅ‚ Modzelewski. I'm studying at Warsaw University of Technology for my Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering. Since last year I have started developing in the field of machine learning. Currently, I'm looking for an internship or a part-time job, where my data science and machine learning skills could be used and developed.
